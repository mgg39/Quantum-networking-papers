# Quantum-tech-papers
During my first year of PhD I will be slowly adding some of the papers I read to this branch:

- An Algebraic Language for Distributed Quantum Computing - Mingsheng Ying, Yuan Feng
       https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4745631
- Review of Distributed Quantum Computing. From single QPU to High Performance Quantum Computing - David Barral, et. al.
       https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01265

# Notes:
